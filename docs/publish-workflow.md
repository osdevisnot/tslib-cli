# The Publish Workflow

For an awesome package, we should of course automate as much as possible. Inspired by [np](https://www.npmjs.com/package/np), `tslib-cli` follows below workflow for publishing to NPM:

- Re-Installs dependencies to ensure your project works with the latest dependency tree.
- Formats your code to ensure unformatted code is not published.
- Lints your code to ensure published version meets the quality standards.
- Runs the tests.
- Ensures the working directory is clean
- Asks you new version to be published
- Publishes the new version to npm
- Pushes commits and tags \(newly & previously created\) to GitHub/GitLab
